    title: "Why I Created a Standalone Companion App After 10+ Overwolf Apps",
    description:
      "After years of developing Overwolf apps, I built the TH.GL Companion App to be lighter, faster, and more flexible ‚Äî with overlays, live maps, and tracking tools outside of Overwolf.",
    content: `
In 2016, I built my first Overwolf app during the **League of Legends Overwolf Dev Challenge** ‚Äî and won it with *Trophy Hunter*, an achievement tracker for LoL. That experience kicked off my journey into building tools for gamers.

Since then, I‚Äôve developed more than 10 Overwolf apps for games like **New World**, **Palworld**, **Once Human**, **Infinity Nikki**, and many others.

But in 2025, I launched something entirely new: the **TH.GL Companion App** ‚Äî a standalone application, independent from Overwolf.

### Overwolf Was a Great Start

Overwolf gave me the tools I needed:
- A strong API for overlays, hotkeys, and in-game data
- Automatic updates and app store visibility
- A way to focus on app development, not deployment infrastructure

It worked well for many years, especially while I was building these tools alongside a full-time job.

### Why I Built My Own

Over time, I began hearing requests for a more lightweight solution. Some users wanted a version of the tools **without extra background services**, installations, or performance overhead.

There were also challenges on the development side. Occasionally, I had to delay updates because of Overwolf platform issues like:
- Missing support for certain games or DX versions
- Crashes and performance issues that weren‚Äôt under my control

Eventually, I decided I wanted to try building my own system ‚Äî one that would give me more control, flexibility, and fewer dependencies.

### What‚Äôs Inside the Companion App

The TH.GL Companion App offers:
- Overlay + second-screen toggle
- Real-time player tracking
- Support for multiple games, including **Palworld**, **Once Human**, **Infinity Nikki**, and more

All without needing to install or run Overwolf.

![App Launcher](/images/app-launcher.webp)

### The Benefits

By moving away from Overwolf, I can:
- Push updates and support new games much faster
- Avoid waiting for platform fixes
- Deliver a smoother experience with fewer restrictions
- Keep everything lightweight and performance-focused

Plus, it‚Äôs been a great learning experience ‚Äî diving into DX injection, overlay rendering, and everything required to build an app like this from scratch.

### How‚Äôs It Going?

The Companion App is still new, but I‚Äôve already seen **hundreds of daily users**, even with a soft launch. It‚Äôs far from done, but the core functionality is solid, and I‚Äôm updating it regularly based on feedback.
