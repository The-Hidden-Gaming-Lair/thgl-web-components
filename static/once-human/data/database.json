He told me to come find him if the Hearst family was ever in trouble, and he even invited me to Sandbank. That's the shelter built in the middle of the river. \"Come see the fruits of my and my friends' labor\", he said.\n\nI want to go, but I know Dad would never let me. Maybe one day, I'll get my chance. I want to leave this place. I want to go to Sandbank. I also want to go north and find Joan...\n\n\n\n",

The uncontrollable problem of \"omega decay\" could not be satisfactorily solved in the technological environment of the 1980s and 1990s. Each year, Rosetta recruited countless top talents from around the world to join its research and security teams, but the following year they had to recruit more people to make up for the losses suffered in various experiments and operations.\n\nIt was not until the last years of the twentieth century that everything came together. The young and talented Dr. Lena Spilman had built the perfect model for controlling omega decay - just waiting for the ideal substance to create the \"Core\" to be found by her.\n\n\n\n"

Almost inevitably, the process of omega decay will be unexpectedly suspended due to various uncontrollable factors.\n\nIn the vast majority of organisms invaded by Stardust, the process is aborted at a very low level, and their \"half-way\" genomes are distorted but still active, which is the cause of well-observed strange and powerful Deviant forms.\n\nTo date, tens of millions of recorded cases of Stardust particle invasion have not resulted in a single known case of 100% complete transformation. If such a thing does exist, the lifeform would be made of pure Stardust energy.\n\nSuch a thing might even be the endpoint of evolution.\n\n\n\n"

Well, she said that it was stamped with the year 1818, and that REALLY knocked me for six, let me tell you.\n\nI tried to just forget all about it, but I seem to be getting worse. Now, it's started happening not just with numbers, but with words too...\n\n\n\n",

Then, the residents of Greenlake Hill arrived, scavenging all available supplies and equipment before departing, leaving this place deserted once more. \n\nBut a man named Isaac Finn stayed behind. A teacher who remained hopeful amidst the end of the days, Isaac planned to transform the abandoned institute into a school to teach the children of Greenlake Hill before the knowledge of past eras was lost to time. \n\nAt least initially, Isaac's passionate idea was supported by some of Greenlake Hill's key individuals, who provided some resources and manpower to renovate the place and worked on collecting worn-out pre-Starfall books. He compiled them into teaching materials for children, who, like the adults, were numbed by their daily struggle for survival, to come and learn...\n\nHope is a flower that may not bear fruit. Despite Isaac's efforts, he ultimately failed. The whole school program was discarded, and the children still went to the workshops and farms. As for the old books, they were likely used as firewood for a meal. \n\nI don't know what eventually happened to Mr. Isaac Finn, as many traces of him were erased after Rosetta reoccupied the place. But I sincerely hope that he's still alive, and I wish I could find him to have a chat. I'd like to tell him that the torch is still burning in the north, and if he's willing, he can join me in traveling there.\n\n\n\n"

With a large population and abundant resources, they maintained significant influence over the entire Chalk Peak region for several years following the Starfall.\n\nHowever, they seemed to have developed a peculiar system of governance, resembling a matriarchy, with several elder women holding the power, and their decisions were often far from wise.\n\nThe shelter, unfortunately, didn't make it to our arrival, falling apart due to internal corruption and external threats. The surviving residents dispersed: some sought refuge in Tall Grass (and it was from them we learned valuable information about this place), some were captured by Rosetta, and some even transformed into Marauders. There are reports of some going west, becoming pioneers on the plains.\n\n\n\n"

          "content": "We carefully approached Sunbury Middle School. Simon Meyer said this place is more dangerous than other areas in the wilderness — not because of Deviants or Stardust, but because it is constantly occupied by a group of extremely vicious bandits.\n\nThese bandits lived nearby before the Starfall, so they're locals, but this doesn't make them any more merciful toward other survivors. Some of Simon's people were captured by them. The look on his face when he talked about it said everything about the terrifying fates they faced.\n\nSince then, Simon's group has been in a long struggle with the bandits. Sandbank, the shelter built on a river, has hardly seen a day of peace, with endless ambushing and counter-ambushing from both sides. The price of blood continues to rise, but neither side has gained a decisive advantage.\n\nThe school ruins need a thorough cleanup. If I can successfully return to the north and help Simon Meyer secure more support from the Union's headquarters, this stalemate will end for sure. This is both for the victims who died at the hands of the bandits and for the development of Sandbank and the Union. There must be land in Sunbury Middle School free from Stardust contamination, and it shouldn't exist as a bandit lair.\n\n\n\n"

In all honesty, things are a lot better here than I thought they would be. Three people on patrol and foraging duty, while the other two stay behind. It seems like a fairly equitable arrangement, with a clear chain of command. Melanie seems like a brave and capable leader.\n\nI had a very pleasant evening last night... alcohol-free, unfortunately. I had a long, productive chat with Melanie, but I made sure to stay off the dangerous topic of the past, of dead loved ones. Our conversation kept circling back to the Union. Melanie seemed interested, and it's not hard to see why. These people have been wandering the wilderness, alone. The Union's resources, the society we've managed to create... The Union can offer a degree of security that these people crave. I hope Melanie decides to join. I like her. Her group would be an excellent asset to the organization.\n\nWe also found a number of other significant features in this area. The bridge and the oil wells across the river, for example, were once an old transportation hub. This place could make an excellent new Union Stronghold - an opportunity for the Union to extend its influence into the Iron River valley. The only potential problem is Rosetta. At one time, this place was used by Rosetta to transfer supplies and manpower. On the eve of Starfall it was hastily evacuated, but according to Melanie, the entire Iron River basin remains firmly in Rosetta's control. \"We're like caged animals,\" Melanie said to me. \"Rosetta lets us live for now - but there's no telling when they'll decide to crack down\". \n\nDespite that, I can see that Melanie still wants to keep up the resistance. But she needs help. I hope she can come to an agreement with the Union. As for me, I said my goodbyes, and embarked on the next leg of our search for survivors, alone.\n\n\n\n"

They also looked for water and food in the rift space for a long time and even set up semi-permanent shelters inside (sadly, these people are nowhere to be found). We have requested that Star-M843 be secured and a special team will arrive shortly.\n\n\n\n",

They had their fingers in quite a few pies, too. They owned restaurants and real estate, and had investments in various light industries, in transportation... The Hearst family exerted their influence on almost every aspect of island life.\n\nOf course, they had been in a steady decline for years, even before the Starfall hit. By the time I was born, the Hearst family's influence had already shrunk significantly. Just the southern corner of the island still truly belonged to them. They also faced a number of internal and external crises (some of which could be said to be self-inflicted). Gradually, the town's population withered and the stores were abandoned. Later, it seems that the Hearts' became involved in the violence with the Wetland gang... \n\nBut anyway, back to the facts. The Hearst family lost nearly all their industrial properties. Only the chemical plant in front of me remains in their hands. It's no longer operational, but it had been struggling for several years even before that. Much to our surprise, however, it seemed to have survived the Starfall.\n\nThere's an electronic calendar inside, and it stopped sometime in 2026. That means it was still operational for several years after the Starfall. I believe that there was a small group of survivors who did their best to stay alive by seeking refuge inside the plant. They managed to survive right up to the winter of 2026 (that was one of the harshest years), when they finally succumbed to famine.\n\nGod Damnit!!! Sorry, I really needed to get that out.\n\nWe were too late, yet again! More than four years too late. There is nothing worth exploring inside that plant now. We noticed a few rare mechanical parts that might have some value, but my team is already overburdened as it is, so we left them where they were.\n\n\n\n"

The Stardust lies thick on the ground like some kind of hellish snow, emitting a blue-black glow. And the broken remains of the once living creatures covering every corner of every house... The whole town is one great, twisted nightmare...\n\nI'm afraid we cannot provide any first-hand intel about Throughville. We have, however, done our best to gather the relevant information (collected from searching the surrounding areas, interviews already conducted with relevant people, and recollections from myself and others). These are our findings:\n\nJesse Sutherland was the youngest member of the Sutherland family and the most highly respected among the younger generation. He was the nephew of the patriarch and managed most of the family's resources before the Starfall. He was an overbearing, fearless, and ruthless man, famed for his greed and profligacy. Throughville was a luxury estate and Jesse Sutherland's home before the Starfall. Tightly guarded and well-equipped, the estate was where Jesse stored most of his vast wealth, which he had extracted from the Dayton Wetlands and surrounding areas. No one knows how Jesse Sutherland met his end, because none of Throughville's residents managed to escape with their lives. Looking at the place now, it's not hard to imagine why they all perished. One likely theory:\n\nJesse Sutherland, along with his guards and a number of close relatives were devoured by Rift Entities shortly after the Starfall, or else got infected with Stardust, and perished without a trace.\n\nThe only unsolved question is, why was the Stardust contamination level so incredibly high in Throughville? Could there be a Rift Entity using this place as their lair...?\n\n\n\n"

According to Brad Lito, a resident who fled to the Sandbank, the Eastern Railway Junction was attacked by Rosetta late last spring. The boss was publicly dealt with, and most of the remaining residents were taken away, their current whereabouts unknown. \n\nIt's a sad story, but one thing intrigues me: the boss of this place (or \"Consul,\" as he styled himself), Owen Hicks. \n\nWhere on earth did this guy come from? No matter who I asked — Brad, Simon, or whoever else — the one-time residents of the Eastern Railway Junction all had a high opinion of Consul Owen (and Simon looked pained to admit it). They said he was brave, decisive, and careful, with an aptitude for management and military strategy. Sounds like he must have been a military man himself, or at least an accomplished official or businessman. \n\nOwen was said to have appeared on the day of the Starfall. Nobody had ever heard of him before then.

Severe Stardust contamination, however, can keep survivors out in the first place, making it safer.\n\n\n\n"

In fact, when a cradle is installed, it is embedded in a Meta-Human's spinal nerves through their back.\n\nIt may seem extreme, but this direct access method allows information held in the helical structure of Stardust particles to be efficiently transmitted straight to a Meta-Human's brain. At the same time, the microcomputer and nano-projector embedded in the cradle can transform information into graphics and motion effects projected onto the surface of the Meta-Human's retina, for clear and easy visual processing.\n\nDr. ███ quickly iterated and improved upon their design for the portable cradle, making for an incredibly modular system. The cradle's hardware and software have since undergone hundreds of upgrades both large and small, but even an original portable cradle prototype could be easily transformed into the latest version with the right spare parts.\n\nAs long as the Meta-Human wearing a cradle possesses average human intelligence, he or she could quickly repair a damaged cradle after less than four hours of training in mechanical principles.\n\n\n\n"

They will never \"come back.\"\n\nInternal experimental data from before Starfall showed that the rate of advanced primates being transformed to Deviants during omega decay was over 99.87%, which is a huge advantage compared to other mammals.\n\nWhen Rosetta returned to the surface in 2029, most of the Great Ones had left and returned to the Rift Space where they had hibernated, but the world was still occupied by a huge number of Deviant of all shapes and sizes.\n\nIn contrast, the surviving humans (including Rosetta staff and survivors on the surface) are dominant in neither numbers nor firepower.

Its exceedingly inert chemical nature renders it impervious to conventional methods of high or low-temperature removal.\n\nTo date, humanity has yet to discover a reliable and effective means of eliminating Stardust residue, and the areas covered by it remain extremely dangerous, life-prohibited zones.

The longest recorded period of decay was seven years and five months. That Meta-Human ultimately could not complete the entire Omega decay process. After the process was unexpectedly terminated, he erupted with approximately 17,500 megawatts of thermal energy over the course of several weeks, before turning into a large mass of black Stardust residue which filled the entire room.\n\n\nUntil Dr. Lena Spilman discovered a feasible method to artificially delay Omega decay, this was the best we could do.\n\n\n\n"

It was only in 2017, the year of Professor Lubeni's death, that human research on the control of the omega decay process first saw the light of day.\n\nUnder the auspices of Dr. Spilman, Rosetta's research team succeeded in using technology to stabilize the omega decay process in humans at up to 41.45% (above the Meta-Human threshold of 37%).\n\nAlthough there are still problems with cost control, this moment is still of great historical significance: humans are beginning to control the birth of the Meta-Human.\n\nPerhaps, in the near future, evolution will become a special type of promotion for Rosetta's elite personnel?\n\nAt this moment, a pair of young brother and sister researchers are emerging, just like Lena Spilman, who brought the rise of Rosetta...

She had been widowed not long into her marriage, leaving her with two young children to raise alone. She managed the orchard and all the surrounding farmland herself.\n\nI was a teenager when I first came to the orchard with some of my older relatives. In between all the wine drinking, I paid a visit to Ms. Anne and negotiated a few mutually beneficial business deals. I didn't really get to know her well though. So much time has passed that I can't even really remember her face too clearly.

In the moonlight, the outline of the ruined buildings makes me think of a pale woman lying on a couch. There is no doubt that a large number of Deviants still lurk among those walls.\n\nThe urge to revisit the site and go deeper into the orchard to find out what happened to Ms. Anne and her family was almost overwhelming. I ordered the expedition to camp as far away from that sad, dangerous site as possible. We would plot a route around it the next morning.\n\n\n\n"

But what I do know is that those people must have deeply cherished the land beneath their feet, for I have witnessed: the fields that had been meticulously tilled, the walls of living rooms decorated with stickers, vibrant lights, love, and patience, the verses carved by guards on the door frames during damp or chilling nights, and the small tombstone dedicated to this town.\n\nAll of this has slowly faded and become indiscernible amidst the encroaching erosion of Stardust. It is truly a shame that we never crossed paths with these people. Had we arrived when it was still a town in flames, the Union would have surely gained another dependable ally in the south of Nalcott Island.\n\nWhere did these people go?

I can almost imagine the blue and purple Stardust spilling out from the Monolith on the day of the Starfall. The town, swallowed up by wave after wave... Most of Alkirk's residents would have simply perished in their sleep.\n\n...Our previous records are wrong. Upon entering the town, we discovered that the plague of Stardust had been tormenting Alkirk's residents even BEFORE the Starfall. The residents had seen the early warning signs. They didn't understand them, but they were scared, that much was clear. Rosetta had the town by the neck by the time they built their Monolith. It seems that the townsfolk were forbidden from telling the outside world about the Monolith, or any of the Deviations they were starting to experience.\n\nThat was all 10 years ago, and the Stardust has mostly dissipated now, but the inhabitants of Alkirk have been irrevocably transformed. We had to wipe out some of these 'inhabitants' when we first arrived, for the safety of the camp. Our expedition party is a highly experienced, highly skilled bunch, and yet, picking off a few of the roaming Deviants who came too close to our camp was the best we could manage. We prevented a full-scale onslaught, but the place remains infested with Deviants.\n\nWe've just set out from Blackfell. We haven't encountered any survivors so far, but this is absolutely to be expected. As I keep telling my troops - no reason to be discouraged. None at all... We're heading south right now. I refuse to believe that humanity has been completely swallowed up by Stardust here. There must be someone out here, still clinging to life.\n\n\n\n"

She worked there as a warehouse supervisor when the Starfall hit and somehow managed to survive the initial attack by the Rift Entity, along with several colleagues. But what happened after that... isn't easy to write.\n\nThe plant workers were desperate and scared. They blamed the factory owners for the attack - not that there's anything they could've done to prevent it, of course. The Sutherland family were the ones who first brokered Rosetta's entry to the island. Driven to madness by their fear, the workers themselves dealt with the plant's managers, brothers Nelson and Donald Sutherland. Then, they turned their uncontrollable anger on the rest of the Sutherland family. Men, women, children, no one was spared... \n\nIt's been more than ten years, and Ms. Han was still on the verge of tears as she told me this story. She said that after witnessing all that destruction, she left the plant alone and headed out into the wilderness on foot. Somehow, despite the Stardust and the circling Rift Entities, she managed to survive. Ms. Han has since never set foot in the chemical plant again, nor does she know what happened to the other workers.\n\nThere's no trace of life at the plant now, but from what they left behind, it seems Ms. Han was right. A group of humans used this place as a shelter after the Starfall. It looks like they managed to hold on for two years, one year, maybe even less. And it's easy to see why. There wasn't much in the way of food stores, and the land around the plant is completely barren even now. The poison of Stardust runs deep.\n\n\n\n"

It was only a medium-sized refinery at best, but it did good business and paid its workers a fair wage. I imagine all this must seem very strange to the younger generation. The Union has done its best to maintain some semblance of social order, but still. The world is so unimaginably different now...\n\nBut what's the use in dwelling on the past? The refinery was abandoned after the Starfall, and now it stands empty. Some survivors must have taken refuge in there at some point though - I saw the remains of a campfire, and some small tents. It was late at night when Stardust first spread to the refinery, and there were only a few kids on guard duty at the time. They didn't stand a chance. Some of them probably still wander the halls of the refinery even now, in a new, twisted form...\n\nThat last bit is just conjecture.\n\nThe facts of our exploration are as follows: we cleared out a few monsters, then conducted a detailed search of the location. It was practically deserted, and we found almost nothing of value, just some metals. No food whatsoever. We're running dangerously low on rations at the moment. If we don't find food in the next week, the expedition... No. We've still got some time. It's not over yet.\n\n\n\n"

He was a loyal comrade, and though our time working together was short, I know that this is a great loss for Meyer's Market and the entire Union.\n\nAlthough you seem reluctant to take on more administrative duties, I must speak plainly: at present, you are Meyer's Market's most dependable individual. Therefore, Ted and I would be greatly relieved if you were willing to consider running for the position of the new mayor.\n\nAll seems well with the maintenance status of the Ridge Transfer Station. It seems the caravans have fulfilled their obligations to maintain the station during their recent trips between Meyer's Market and the north.\n\nThings are going smoothly on my end, and I should arrive at Tall Grass as planned. I will keep a close eye on the group that you mentioned. If they indeed originate from the west as you suspected, then we must be mindful that they may already have infiltrated Tall Grass.\n\nI wish us both the best.\n\n\n\n",

Denzel's vehicle was equipped with a reconnaissance drone, and both he and Lena swear on their lives that they kept the drone hovering overhead the whole time while passing through the mountains. No Deviant would be able to get past that drone. But then, suddenly, they found themselves surrounded by Deviants on all sides. It was like those monsters had appeared out of thin air... \n\nThis was also the day the Lito kid reported seeing a couple of Rosetta tankers parked east of the Ridge Camp, right? They were parked there until the afternoon, and then finally drove back to their own base to the west, the drivers looking pretty pissed off about something. \n\nWell, it turns out those Rosetta tankers were stationed only a few miles from where Denzel was attacked. \n\nI know that it was Rosetta who ordered that fuel shipment—but they still haven't paid us yet, have they?\n\n\n\n",

But from the traces left behind, it was evident that the residents put up a resilient struggle. *Sigh* Regardless of age, they all held on until the last moment in the confrontation with despair... They did not give in. \n\n The survivors at the Tall Grass also confirmed to us the harsh truth: no one survived. We took the necessary supplies (some of them were at the places where Ted had told me they would be), and before we left, I picked a few strawflowers from the side of the road and let them drift in the breeze blowing in the direction of the town of Brookham.

Trent Palmieri claimed that he had worked here before the catastrophe. He provided a lot of information about the Monolith and Stardust Infection to a local contact with the aim of exposing Rosetta's dastardly deeds (ultimately it didn't make much of a difference). I believe what he said is true, but, well, it's hard for me to imagine how someone as frail and dorky-looking as Trent could pull off espionage like that in the heavily guarded Rosetta Hospital. For starters, how did he manage to slip past Rosetta's tight security?\n\nAnyway, things are different now. No one from Rosetta is still active around here. The place has become pretty heavily polluted by Stardust, and thanks to the Monolith, it's likely to stay that way.

It was out of consideration for Thomas that we waited this long to venture into the town.

He'd probably make a much better expedition leader than me...\n\nIt seems that the Deviants have been cleared out since the last time we were here, although it's not clear whether this was the work of Rosetta, or those bandits. There's not much here anymore - just some empty factories, run-down homes and a trashed supermarket. The old Rippleby is long gone, that's for sure. The Union has a few members from Rippleby, and according to them, this town used to be the most beautiful town on the lower reaches of the Iron River. Then, the town's mayor came to an arrangement with Rosetta. Rippleby's factories, market and bustling fishing port all benefited from Rosetta's deep pockets, and the town began to grow rapidly.\n\nStanding here now, though, it's hard to believe that this place had ever really been prosperous. Tonight the expedition will camp out inside one of the town's old houses. It's been a long time since I slept in a real bed. Unfortunately, it seems that the last group to pass through here (it's unclear whether they were human survivors, Rosetta soldiers, or bandits) have already picked the place clean.

Having spent so long searching, finding a group of survivors has really lifted the group's spirits.\n\nWere the survivors somehow able to discover that the sandbar in the river was still unpolluted by Stardust? It all seems so unlikely, even thinking about it now. The survivors were just a bunch of regular people. Healthy, but not exceptionally skilled. We had a lot in common. We established an especially good relationship with their leader - Simon Meyer. Simon is a really charismatic guy. He gave us a lot of useful information about the surrounding area, and even volunteered to serve as our guide. He showed us the way to some important yet remote sites, like Harborside.\n\nSimon's theory about what happened to this town seems very reasonable to me. Simon believes that Harborside was ransacked by a Rift Entity early on. Even if anyone managed to escape this attack, they must've perished sometime during the subsequent decade of hardship. The way things currently stand, there is no possibility of settling here. The land and air are both still thick with Stardust - even the sea off the dock is covered in a thick blue-black residue.\n\nBut there was still value in coming here. With the information we've gathered, we'll be able to chart a more accurate map of Nalcott Island. Which places are safe, which places are worth investigating in more depth, and so on.\n\nMy hope is that one day, this information will motivate us... the Union... all of humanity... to take back this world for ourselves.\n\n\n\n"

Who'd have thought that after the Starfall, this place would become such a prime piece of real estate! Somehow, the oil wells managed to survive relatively intact.\n\nWe also found some canned goods - tuna, luncheon meat and so on. Maybe a maintenance crew left them? This place had no restaurant, after all. It was so delicious, I got to thinking - when was the last time I ate canned tuna? 5 years ago, at the Union? No, it was 3 years ago, in the storeroom of that old fast food joint in the Dayton Wetlands.\n\nAnyway, we scoped out the area and didn't find any signs of a bandit presence. We stayed for several days, and didn't see anyone from Rosetta, either. Before we showed up, this place was Nalcott Deviant territory. Maybe the Deviants will come back as soon as we leave, or maybe some poor human survivors will pass through. Either way, I don't expect this place to become a major Stronghold for any faction in the near future. It's a safe distance from Rosetta - unlike the East Blackfell Junction - and resources are more plentiful. It's Melanie's for the taking, in my opinion.\n\nI haven't seen Melanie in such a long time.

It is responsible for purging targets chosen by the organization's leadership, from Deviants and beasts to entire human settlements, even people or departments within Rosetta itself.\n\nGiven the range of combat scenarios its members are expected to face, they are armed with weapons and equipment two or three generations ahead of those available to regular survivors. Thus, one member is capable of overwhelming multiple targets using high-caliber gauss rifles, carbon fiber reactive armor, and smart tactical devices. Such firepower allows them to \"cleanse\" Deviants with ease.\n\nAs an elite vanguard force, the Special Response Team is not immune to casualties, and frequent personnel changes are required.\n\nTo meet recruitment demands, qualified V1 personnel are selected and trained. Members of the Special Response Team frequently rely on neurological stimulants to improve their alertness, the side affects of which reduce their life spans considerably.\n\n\n\n"

They exist only to proliferate and spread. \n\nEpiphytes follow a clearly defined life-cycle. During the initial stage they are known as Deviants, having mutated after short-term exposure to Stardust. As most bodily tissue is quickly consumed and transformed, they are notably slender. Deviants are not generally predisposed toward violence, perhaps due to a lingering awareness of past human ideals. They are drawn to human settlements where their mostly humanoid appearance and gentle murmuring can make it difficult for survivors to kill them without feeling a sense of guilt.\n\nAfter a while, Stardust within the host multiplies, turning them into a Gnawer. Gnawers no longer resemble humans, except for their torsos. Their most distinctive feature is sporophyte tentacles on the back of their heads, which are infused with Stardust and spread pollution to their surroundings. Spreading Stardust is the fundamental motive behind a Gnawer's actions, therefore they are highly aggressive, and will attack people on site (often by biting or spitting). \n\nOnce all energy in the host has been exhausted by Stardust, it enters the final phase of its life-cycle. The host will transform into an infected plant, inhabiting the Impasse, or in some cases, into a special type of Kin, known as a Star Walker.\n\n\n\n"

The committee suspects that Mary's body may possess a conduit for channeling Stardust energy, similar to the Silver Gate.

I saw with my own eyes his right hand was deformed and enlarged and then returned to its original shape. It was almost as if he was trying to follow in Mary's footsteps. The subtlety of the coupling experiment lies in this, the entangled power brought by an emotional bond, as long as it is controlled and manipulated, it could prove a powerful weapon.\n\nDr. Mannheim revealed that the top leadership has been made aware of recent LEA experimentation. As such, we may be saying goodbye to these two this year. In any case, experiments conducted at headquarters will surely be more rigorous than those conducted here.\n\nTomorrow's work schedule:\n-Clean Henry's memory data.\n-Evaluate the latest containment breach simulation data.\n\nP.S.

We allow the subjects to exist in their natural environment, unaware of our interference in their daily lives...\n\nWe often say that follow-up observations need to be performed while the sample is totally unaware, since the observations are almost quantum mechanical in nature: as soon as the sample discovers the observer, all its possibilities instantaneously collapse...\n\n\n\n"

No one can verify these rumors' validity, but no one can deny them either, including Rosetta themselves.

I fear one day my little angel will be covered with scars.\n\nI have discovered what made her this way, and it involves the death of Sophia's mother, my wife Donna Green.

Donna died shielding Sophia from them.\n\nI feel so useless, all I could do was arrange a funeral for Donna.

She used to be so lively and cheerful, all the workers on the farm loved her. But now...\n\n\n\n",

Row upon row of unfinished houses, the freshly-poured foundations for luxury beach-side villas... Even a movie theater, although it was only half-finished (they never did finish it, in the end).\n\nOf course, most of the town's real estate, the motel, the supermarkets, and most of the other commercial properties all belonged to one certain member of the Sutherland family. I only stayed in that town for as long as it took me to pay for a tank of overpriced gas. Something about the place gave me the creeps.\n\nAnd then there was the Starfall. Overlook Town will never get built now. All that luxury - the beautiful furniture, the expensive appliances - is still just sitting there gathering dust. The whole town stands like a monument to the people who perished trying to construct it.\n\nThe place was silent as a tomb when we arrived. From a distance, the old site looked almost completely intact. No signs of the Marauders. Keith and Amelia were both strongly in favor of exploring, but I decided not to take the risk. There are dark forces lurking in that place, I'm sure of it. Otherwise, the place would've been stripped clean of valuables long ago.\n\n\n\n"

As a clone with a complete personality, she entered a new stage of development.\nMary was indoctrinated with evolutionary ideologies and became a loyal adherent to them, believing that evolution was humanity's only hope. She was trained to control Stardust Energy by absorbing various Deviations, and quickly mastered multiple combat disciplines, catching the attention of Rosetta's security department.\nUpon reaching adulthood, Mary was appointed to lead a team of elite Rosetta agents responsible for dangerous search-and-rescue missions. She believes in the necessity of sacrificing the weak for the greater good, believing it is the only way to save more lives.\n\n\n\n",

Then that means, eventually... this Stardust will just disappear, all by itself. \n\nOwen Hicks says that the half-life of a Stardust particle is under 40 years. I don't know where he learned that.
